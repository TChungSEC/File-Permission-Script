A simple lightweight Bash script that allows you to change the file permissions of a single file or entire directory.

To use this script:

   Save the script in a file (e.g., change_permissions.sh).
  
   Make the script executable: `chmod +x change_permissions.sh`.
  
  Run the script with two arguments:
      
The first argument is the file or directory path. The second argument is the desired permissions (e.g., 755).

example usage:

 `./change_permissions.sh /path/to/file.txt 644`

  or

  `./change_permissions.sh /path/to/directory 755`
